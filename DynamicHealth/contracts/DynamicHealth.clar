;; Dynamic Health Insurance Premium Smart Contract
;; This contract manages health data analysis and dynamic insurance premium calculations based on
;; risk assessment, health metrics, lifestyle factors, and predictive health modeling.
;; It provides secure health data management, privacy-preserving analytics, automated premium
;; adjustments, and incentive mechanisms for healthy lifestyle choices while maintaining HIPAA-like standards.
