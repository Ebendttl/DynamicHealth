‚ú® Features
----------

-   **Dynamic Premium Calculation**: Premiums are not static. They are dynamically adjusted based on a comprehensive risk assessment that considers a policyholder's health, lifestyle, and age.

-   **Secure Health Data Management**: Utilizes a secure, on-chain mapping system to store health and lifestyle data with user consent, adhering to **HIPAA-like standards**.

-   **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Data is processed in a way that respects user privacy, with consent being a core component of the system.

-   **Incentive Mechanisms**: Rewards policyholders for healthy lifestyle choices with premium discounts, promoting proactive health management.

-   **Predictive Health Modeling**: Incorporates advanced analytics to project future health trends and risks, enabling more accurate and personalized premium pricing.

-   **Comprehensive Risk Assessment Engine**: A sophisticated public function that ties together all health and lifestyle data to provide a holistic risk score and an optimized premium.

-   **Audit Trail**: Records every premium adjustment, creating a transparent and auditable history.

-   **Automated Adjustments**: The system is designed to automate premium adjustments based on predefined periods, ensuring premiums remain fair and relevant.

üèõÔ∏è Contract Architecture
-------------------------

The contract is written in **Clarity**, a decidable language for the Stacks blockchain. It is structured to be modular and secure, with clearly defined data maps, private helper functions, and public endpoints.

-   **Constants**: Defines key parameters like the base premium, multipliers, and weight factors for different health metrics, ensuring easy configuration.

-   **Data Maps**: Organized into distinct maps for `insurance-policies`, `health-profiles`, `lifestyle-metrics`, `genetic-risk-factors`, and `premium-adjustments` to maintain data integrity and logical separation.

-   **Private Functions**: Helper functions (`calculate-age-risk-factor`, `calculate-health-score`, `calculate-lifestyle-score`, `determine-risk-category`) are kept private to ensure that core logic cannot be called directly, enhancing security and data consistency.

-   **Public Functions**: Exposes a minimal set of public functions to interact with the contract, such as `create-health-profile`, `update-lifestyle-metrics`, `create-insurance-policy`, `pay-premium`, and the main `execute-comprehensive-health-risk-assessment-and-premium-optimization`.

### Public Functions

-   `(create-health-profile (age uint) (bmi uint) (systolic uint) (diastolic uint) (cholesterol uint) (is-smoker bool) (exercise-freq uint))`

    -   **Description**: Allows a user to create their initial health profile. It requires various health metrics and performs basic validation.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   `age`: The policyholder's age.

        -   `bmi`: Body Mass Index.

        -   `systolic`: Systolic blood pressure.

        -   `diastolic`: Diastolic blood pressure.

        -   `cholesterol`: Cholesterol level.

        -   `is-smoker`: A boolean indicating smoking status.

        -   `exercise-freq`: Exercise frequency.

    -   **Returns**: `(ok true)` on success, or an error.

-   `(update-lifestyle-metrics (steps uint) (sleep-hours uint) (stress uint) (diet-score uint) (mental-score uint))`

    -   **Description**: Enables a user to update their lifestyle metrics. This data is crucial for the dynamic premium calculation.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   `steps`: Daily steps.

        -   `sleep-hours`: Hours of sleep per night.

        -   `stress`: Stress level.

        -   `diet-score`: Quality of diet score.

        -   `mental-score`: Mental health score.

    -   **Returns**: `(ok true)` on success, or an error.

-   `(create-insurance-policy)`

    -   **Description**: Creates a new insurance policy for the caller. The policy is initialized with a base premium and a "PENDING_ASSESSMENT" risk category.

    -   **Parameters**: None.

    -   **Returns**: `(ok policy-id)` on success, or an error if a health profile does not exist.

-   `(pay-premium (policy-id uint))`

    -   **Description**: Facilitates premium payments. The correct amount is automatically transferred from the policyholder to the contract.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   `policy-id`: The unique ID of the policy to pay for.

    -   **Returns**: `(ok true)` on success, or an error.

-   `(execute-comprehensive-health-risk-assessment-and-premium-optimization (policy-id uint) (include-predictive-modeling bool) (enable-wellness-incentives bool) (activate-continuous-monitoring bool) (generate-intervention-recommendations bool))`

    -   **Description**: The core function of the contract. It executes a comprehensive risk analysis, calculates an optimized premium, and updates the policy. It returns a detailed assessment report.

    -   **Parameters**:

        -   `policy-id`: The policy ID to assess.

        -   `include-predictive-modeling`: A boolean to enable or disable predictive analytics.

        -   `enable-wellness-incentives`: A boolean to apply premium discounts for healthy behavior.

        -   `activate-continuous-monitoring`: A boolean to simulate continuous monitoring.

        -   `generate-intervention-recommendations`: A boolean to generate personalized health advice.

    -   **Returns**: `(ok assessment-results)` on success, or an error.

### Private Functions

-   `(calculate-age-risk-factor (age uint))`

    -   **Description**: Calculates a risk score based on age. Older ages are assigned a higher risk factor.

-   `(calculate-health-score (health-data { ... }))`

    -   **Description**: Computes a single health score from various health metrics like BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking status. Higher scores indicate better health.

    -   **Description**: Aggregates various lifestyle metrics such as steps, sleep, stress, and diet quality into a single score. Higher scores represent a healthier lifestyle.

-   `(determine-risk-category (health-score uint) (lifestyle-score uint) (genetic-score uint))`

    -   **Description**: Determines a policyholder's risk category (e.g., "LOW_RISK", "MODERATE_RISK") by combining the health, lifestyle, and genetic scores into an overall risk score.
